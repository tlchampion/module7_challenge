# Module 7 Challenge

This is the Module 7 Challenge for the FinTech Bootcamp. This challenge's topic is focused on SQL queries and visualizations using a series of ETF analysis tasks. 

In addition to using a Jupyter Notebook for analysis tasks, the voilà package was used in order to prepare an interactive webpage for presenting the notebook contents.

## Technologies

All code is contained within the included jupyter lab notebook. 

Python version 3.9.15 was used to complete this challenge and the following additional libraries were utilized:
* pandas
* numpy

## Installation Guide

A working python environment is required. The included environmnet.yml file can be used to create a conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```


Alternatively, an existing environment can be used in which case Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, hvplot, sqlalchemy and voilà must be installed if not already available. They may be installed using pip:

```
pip install jupyterlab
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install hvplot
pip install geoviews

```

## Usage

The included .ipynb file should be opened in Jupyter Lab, which can be started in the configured python environment

```
jupyter lab

```

Details on using Jupyter Lab are beyond the scope of this project. Please consult the [Jupyter Lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) for usage details.
